Objective:

> To Move forward for Aiding Blind People through Object Detection, 
  Initially, We Need to Understand the Modular Approaches for Object Detection which would be
  Feasible in Real-Life Scenario.

Flow:

> YOLO Models are Considered to be the Best for Object Detection.
> As a Result, we'll Make a Comparative Analysis on Best and Famous YOLO Models, i.e.,
  YOLOv5 and YOLOv8, for Research Work on Custom Dataset (Traffic Signals and Signs).

Parameters of Comparison:

> Speed and Precision stands to the Prominent Aspects when Identifying any Object. Thus, 
  A Detailed Analysis will be Done on these Models on our Custom Dataset to Explicate, which
  Model Performs the Best.

Bonus:

> The Comparison will not be Restricted to YOLO Models only but SSD Models as Well.

Future Scope:

> After Understanding OD Methodological Outlook, we'll move forward with Distance Estimation
  and Voice output for the Same.

That's It.


Implementation:

1] Dataset:

> Dataset is Opensourced from Roboflow with 2093 Images with 17 Classes of Road Signs and Signals.(classes like red signal , turn right ,turn left)
> The Split of Dataset is: Train (66% - 1400 Images), Validate (23% - 488 Images),
and Test (11% - 229 Images).
> The Dataset is Well-Balanced.
> Dataset Link: https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-100/road-signs-6ih4y/dataset/2
> Images Ratio: 640x640 (Suitable for YOLO Models).

2] Comparison b/w YOLOv5 and YOLOv8:

> We've mAP Values for Comparison and the Accuracy and Loss Graphs for Both the Models.

> YOLOv5: YOLOv5 is the Deep Learning-Based Architecture, which we selected for this Research. 
It achieves state-of-the-art results in the Object Detection Field. In comparison to other Deep
Learning Architectures, YOLOv5 is Simple and Reliable. It needs much less Computational Power 
than other Architectures, while keeping comparable Results and Performing much faster than 
other Networks. YOLOv5 strongly utilizes the architecture of YOLOv4. The Encoder used in YOLOv5
is CSPDarknet. Along with Path Aggregation Network (PANet) they make up the whole Network 
Architecture. In comparison to the YOLOv4, Activation Functions were modiﬁed 
(LeakyReLU and Hardswish Activations were replaced with SiLU [19] Activation Function).
The selection of YOLOv5 Architecture for this Research was Motivated by Several Reasons:
a] The Network is currently State-of-the-Art in the Fast Objects Detection Field.
b] The Architecture is Light-Weight; this allows us to Train the Model using Small 
Computational Resources and keep it Cost-Effective. 
c] Small size of the Model has the Potential to be used in Mobile Devices.

> YOLOv8: YOLOv8 is built on the YOLOv5 Framework and Includes Several Architectural and 
Developer Experience Improvements. 
YOLOv8 is an anchor-free model. This means it Predicts Directly the Center of an Object 
instead of the Offset from a known Anchor Box. Anchor Free Detection Reduces the Number of Box 
Predictions, which Speeds up Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), A Complicated Post Processing step that 
sifts through Candidate Detections after Inference.
The stem's first 6x6 conv is replaced by a 3x3, the main building block was changed, and C2f 
replaced C3 . The module is summarized in the picture below, where "f" is the number of features, 
"e" is the expansion rate and CBS is a block composed of a Conv, a BatchNorm and a SiLU later.
In C2f, all the outputs from the Bottleneck (fancy name for two 3x3 convs with residual connections) 
are concatenated. While in C3 only the output of the last Bottleneck was Used.
The Bottleneck is the same as in YOLOv5 but the first conv's kernel size was changed 
from 1x1 to 3x3. From this information, we can see that YOLOv8 is starting to revert 
to the ResNet block defined in 2015.
In the neck, features are concatenated directly without forcing the same channel dimensions. 
This reduces the parameters count and the overall size of the Tensors.
YOLOv8 augments images during training online. At each epoch, the model sees a slightly 
different variation of the images it has been provided.
One of those augmentations is called mosaic augmentation. 
This involves stitching four images together, forcing the model to learn objects in 
new locations, in partial occlusion, and against different Surrounding Pixels.

> YOLOv5 vs YOLOv8: When it comes to Object Detection, there are Many Models Available. 
However, YOLOv8 and YOLOv5 are 02 of the Most Popular and State-of-the-Art Models created by 
Ultralytics. YOLOv8 is the Latest Addition to the YOLO family, which builds Upon the Success 
of Previous Versions and Introduces New Features and Improvements to Boost Performance and Flexibility. 
YOLOv5, on the other hand, is known for its Speed, Simplicity, and Accuracy.

3] Conclusion: YOLOv5 Performs Better for Our Dataset, with a Minor Difference,
but as the YOLOv5 Model is Light-weight in Nature, It Suits the Best for our Future Scope.

4] Future Scope: We Got the Model which we Would Use in Our Real-time System. As a Result,
We will Now, Instantiate the Process of Formulation of a System with the Integration of 
Hardware and Software to Aid Blind People on Roads through Road Signs and Signal Detection 
Contemplating to them through Text to Speech.
